"""spanforge.auto — Automatic integration discovery and patching.

Call :func:`setup` to automatically detect and patch all SpanForge-supported
LLM libraries that are installed in the current environment.  This eliminates
the need to manually import each integration module.

Usage \u2014 fastest path to value::

    import spanforge.auto
    spanforge.auto.setup()  # patches everything installed

Or call explicitly for programmatic control::

    from spanforge.auto import setup
    patched = setup(verbose=True)
    # patched = {"openai", "anthropic"}

Note:
----
:func:`setup` is **not** called automatically on import.  You must call it
explicitly so that importing :mod:`spanforge` never silently monkey-patches
third-party libraries without your consent.

Supported libraries (patched when installed):
    * **openai** — :mod:`spanforge.integrations.openai`
    * **anthropic** — :mod:`spanforge.integrations.anthropic`
    * **groq** — :mod:`spanforge.integrations.groq`
    * **ollama** — :mod:`spanforge.integrations.ollama`
    * **together** — :mod:`spanforge.integrations.together`

Callback-based integrations (register manually):
    * **LangChain** — use :class:`~spanforge.integrations.langchain.LLMSchemaCallbackHandler`
    * **LlamaIndex** — use :class:`~spanforge.integrations.llamaindex.LLMSchemaEventHandler`
    * **CrewAI** — use :func:`~spanforge.integrations.crewai.patch`

Security note
-------------
Monkey-patching is only applied when the target library is already installed.
The patching flag ``_spanforge_patched`` prevents double-patching.  Each
integration is wrapped in a ``try/except`` so a broken integration never
prevents the others from loading.
